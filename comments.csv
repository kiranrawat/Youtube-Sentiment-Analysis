U__YrDLoHRw,Can we get the pdf for the a6design one? I'd love to see more of that! It's incredible
WZKp-MExJxI,How do u calculate distance between text as you make your own text?
U__YrDLoHRw,"$70 - They aren't leaves, it's a lotus."
U__YrDLoHRw,$135 guy won this challenge

U__YrDLoHRw,The 135 dollar guy killed it
U__YrDLoHRw,This is the first video i have seen by you and I like your voice
9nCTq5euTzI,Best Youtube Ad ever.
U__YrDLoHRw,135 guy FTW
U__YrDLoHRw,Excellent breakdown Will. This was interesting.
U__YrDLoHRw,"I came down here ot brag on the 135 guy, ut it seems that everyone beat me to it."
dQjcqEE37jA,great video. Thank you.
U__YrDLoHRw,OMG that 135$ guy is insane I loved the Logo so much
U__YrDLoHRw,"A6Designs. He is obviously not working for the money. Hey, quick question, where did you get your chair?"
U__YrDLoHRw,Not sure how that 400$ logo would work as an app icon. App icons need to be color driven and simple with as few details as possible. That probably works more as a brand logo than an app icon
U__YrDLoHRw,The $135 guy killed it. He should charge $500.
U__YrDLoHRw,"Everyone ne gushing over 135$ guy 
Totally overlooking how amazing 40$ guy was. 

Their both my top logos"
U__YrDLoHRw,The first one is the visual studio logo.
U__YrDLoHRw,"$135 does it for me, even the Tee shirts look great . I am sure he will do well"
U__YrDLoHRw,"It's kerning, not tracking."
U__YrDLoHRw,This video is so tired.
U__YrDLoHRw,"I feel scammed watching this.
Nothing got better after the pro.
You know which one I'm talking about."
U__YrDLoHRw,The $135 guy is an engineer
U__YrDLoHRw,"Please tell me that after this video, you give the 135$ some extra tip. He basically designed a whole marketing plan."
U__YrDLoHRw,"it appears that every one likes the $135 design. Not only the price, that design to me amongst the all is the best one as well. The logo looks very simple and elegant, also symbolic. Love it."
U__YrDLoHRw,"Since you have no actual app to use these for, would you mind the public using them? Not for any commercial production, but rather just as pfps?"
U__YrDLoHRw,Why call it fiverr? Should be fiverrx100.
U__YrDLoHRw,The last one was kinda genius. The icon is a head (mind) with scenery(scape) in it
U__YrDLoHRw,You speak so slow.. im watching you on double speed is better.
U__YrDLoHRw,"Damn I wanted to participate 😂

The guy for $135 literally did one of the best logos and the best ways of presenting it"
U__YrDLoHRw,why did you like the last one so much ???? it was defiantly the weakest design ! the £135 guy all the way .... very professional and matched  the brief exactly
U__YrDLoHRw,$70 seem overpriced tho
U__YrDLoHRw,I love will and his videos but it’s weird how he said all the logos are amazing and perfect. Almost seems biased.
U__YrDLoHRw,"man, designers are such snobs. So glad I quit the industry."
U__YrDLoHRw,135$ designer was the best by far! He needs to raise his prices!
U__YrDLoHRw,3:18 That looks like fucking Arby's logo
U__YrDLoHRw,"The most expensive guy delivered the most useless logo, seriously except web this logo would be a pain in the ass to work with anywhere else."
U__YrDLoHRw,This dude got the shortest arms
U__YrDLoHRw,"When creating art, it is not about money but about personality. Everyone can do fascinating things regardless of the financial evaluation."
U__YrDLoHRw,9:15 looks like an app to remind you to take your birth control
U__YrDLoHRw,"Not the best value for money , just do it yourself"
U__YrDLoHRw,its not leaves its a lotus flower. The lotus sutra is very influential in zen buddhism. You assholes don't know what zen means at all.
U__YrDLoHRw,"man, now i'm sad this isn't an app. i would get it just for the aesthetics of the $135 or $450 one alone, not mentioning i love meditation."
9nCTq5euTzI,"you never explained the principle behind grids, it just seems like instructions for a specific logo not understanding the principle of logo design using grids"
U__YrDLoHRw,Very Nice
U__YrDLoHRw,Amazing
U__YrDLoHRw,"""I'm not sure why there's a music note in there ....""
Brief: a guided meditation app _primarily with additional zen music features, calming sounds to help you focus_ ...
Yup, no idea where he got the idea that music was involved :?"
U__YrDLoHRw,.
U__YrDLoHRw,"Those aren't leaves, that's a lotus flower, which is cliche but very iconic and important in Buddhism."
U__YrDLoHRw,I really like the $450 one.
U__YrDLoHRw,this is garbage Youtube content lol be original man
B-F7H1xVcec,can i use any type of fonts ( paid or free) without licensing in my commercial projects to earn money ? i came to know that font licencing is must for paid fonts..what if i use paid fonts without license in my commercial logo design and deliver logo to client ? as a student i dont have enough money to buy a font license..please anyone help me.....
U__YrDLoHRw,"It’s a font, not a typeface"
9nCTq5euTzI,"I tried to do this method in Vectornator and couldn't figure it out, do you know if it is possible to do in Vectornator or could you make a tutorial about it?"
U__YrDLoHRw,I hope the $135 designer watched this video and realizes how much more they should be charging.
U__YrDLoHRw,"The $135 guy deffinitly finnished some graphic design school, making a brandbook when designing a logo is a must be, the only one who's offer was fair, proffesional and atractive, deserves huge tips. The rest of the ""Designers"" are a joke. The last guy is a thief who has no idea what graphic design is and demands huge amounts of money for 2010-style work. Not cool."
U__YrDLoHRw,At 135 dollars it's not bad
U__YrDLoHRw,"Wow that’s a really thick lawn, glad your 4 cylinder can handle it 😂"
U__YrDLoHRw,"You should get someone else to buy the commissions for you, and review them without knowing the price, to remove bias."
U__YrDLoHRw,"I actually really don't like the last one... it's too complex and overdesigned, barely even looks suitable for a website, much less an app icon. It also doesn't feel meditative or zen in any way.
I think #3 did the best job on all these points. The logo is simple and legible, but the artist clearly put a lot of thought into making it fit the theme, as well as making the text fit the icon."
U__YrDLoHRw,what program did the last person use for the logos?
U__YrDLoHRw,"The 135$ one is not only the one that made more work and did it better, but the logo look soo nice and it look like premium luxury"
9nCTq5euTzI,"This is what in my entire design career wanted to learn and for the first time, someone explained it so well that I am commenting in middle of this video. Thank a million."
U__YrDLoHRw,"no kidding the $450 was so lame I didn't even finish watching your video, and the $135 guy presented something ""cool"" but spent more time on telling what he did than actually working on the logo."
U__YrDLoHRw,"You should show these logos to another designer and make them guess the cost of each, that would be interesting"
U__YrDLoHRw,"A branding logo should cost 10,000$
and the 450$ logo is not in proportion and don't understand the principle of logo design, the 135$ guy did great and he must charge more than 135$ and also fiverr is a trash site for graphic designer"
U__YrDLoHRw,not a fan of these design whore websites.
U__YrDLoHRw,"It almost seems as if the $450 guy kinda ripped you off, I'm almost sure i've seen those assets in a free logo software.
The $135 guy is amazing, I will definitely be hiring him in the near future."
U__YrDLoHRw,"A6 Designs really hit it out of the park. He created the best design and concept without any consideration for the money.  As I review the comments below me, it is a common consensus."
U__YrDLoHRw,i kinda felt i made a competition and the winner get 1000$ it would be so hard for me to pick one! I honestly if you didn't mention the prices i would pick the 135$ but right after that i would pick the 450$ but knowing that cost 450$ is too much for me honestly and I would always go with the 135$ sweet spot for a price and work of art! I also love the simple work! and it kinda fit very well too I'm not saying no to the rest.. the rest isn't something that would make my own app interesting to myself but forever probably yeah!
U__YrDLoHRw,The $135 guy is called a6designs. He is now charging just over $141
U__YrDLoHRw,Cool and nice on my channel for my intro I had my best friend draw my intro and had someone on fiver animated it for me
U__YrDLoHRw,Hahaha first one is a mirror of the Visual Studio Logo
9nCTq5euTzI,i always wanted to learn grid related tutorial <3 thanks
U__YrDLoHRw,Please do one for web developer
U__YrDLoHRw,wow the $135 guy really went for it. great work.
U__YrDLoHRw,$135! needs a raise...
UsB6MV56fLo,fucking tiny notepad
U__YrDLoHRw,"I'm a professional advertiser, I've worked for worldwide brands from Germany, Spain, Brazil, Colombia, Túnez, USA... and the best of all for me its the $135 amazing job, minimal, and fits perfectly with the brief"
U__YrDLoHRw,"Rather than logo for fake company just for the sake making this video, how about logo for your subscribers company who need it ?"
U__YrDLoHRw,135> 450 > 40> those other two chuckleheads.
U__YrDLoHRw,"IMO the guy that charged 135 was the best one, the 450 dollar guy to me didnt really get you concept because they all did just look like a sleep app icon, where as the 135$ guy to me at least hit it dead on with everything being symmetrical and calming, breaking down all the zen aspects to it. like i was legit getting calmer and relaxed looking at the work of the 135$ guy"
U__YrDLoHRw,He complains about 4 lines in a plant but the galaxy face was just right in detail?
U__YrDLoHRw,4:06 Visual Studio logo
0GLAm2bCyCc,I will wait until Logitech version of it way cheaper
0GLAm2bCyCc,lol I see you're suffering bad there with COVID hair!
U__YrDLoHRw,"Hi, interesting video!!! I was just wondering why did you only choose male designers? This was probably just an unconscious coincident. Are there more male designers on Fiverr?"
U__YrDLoHRw,"A6 Design.. ""$135 man"" .. Got it.. He gets all the business from now on."
U__YrDLoHRw,I am the 135$ Guy.
U__YrDLoHRw,"Another vote to ""$135 Guy""...they provided not only great work but also an insight on how their thought process went into it. Great result overall and totally worth the money."
U__YrDLoHRw,KayFallDesigns’ concept (5:50) is rather similar to the icon for the Meditopia app
U__YrDLoHRw,"Was interesting to watch, what you get when you spend  5  times more than average price."
U__YrDLoHRw,Wow that $70 one was pure garbage. Looks like they just got some clipart and smashed it together. Also look how bad the line work is on the “final” version.
5tXFcLyoTsk,"I know how i spent well my quarantine.
Binge watched a lot of your videos, clear and dope work mate."
U__YrDLoHRw,Lester?
U__YrDLoHRw,"The $135 dollar job was amazing - you didn't even mention the fact that the design has a icon form of a lotus blossom, and the symbol for infinity as major components. The $135 job is the one I would have picked."
U__YrDLoHRw,Fiverr has devalued the design industry beyond recovery.  It's hard to make a living as a designer when prices are so low and the artwork takes so long to create.  It's not a sustainable model.  Designers must charge more for their time and expertise.
TKHrZeHfKos,I got procreate today and when I used it I was like this app is CHEAP AF for what we’re getting LOvE procreate!!
U__YrDLoHRw,"can you hire me too...(^^,) i'm freelance designer"
U__YrDLoHRw,"#1. $450
#2. $135
#3. $40
#4. $295
#5. $70"
